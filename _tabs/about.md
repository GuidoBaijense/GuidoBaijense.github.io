🙋‍♂️ Cool to see you here. You might already know that my name is Guido Baijense. I'm a Microsoft Identity consultant for [InSpark](https://www.inspark.nl) where I help organizations to work safer 🔐 and easier. 🏖️ I strive for organizations without passwords 🔑 but with ease of use and a clear identity lifecycle. 🔁 

My background is in media and sales and I'm interested in all developments around the Microsoft Stack. At the same time I really like cycling. Especially to watch, but every once in a while I'm on my racing bike as well.
 
Currently, my focus is on Microsoft Entra and Identity Governance. So you know what kind of blogs to expect the coming months.
Do you want to talk about Microsoft Identity or something else Tech related? Send me a message!
